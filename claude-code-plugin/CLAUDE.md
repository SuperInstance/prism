- Smart batching with optimal worker utilization
- Fallback to sequential processing for small batches

#### 2. Enhanced Search with Fuzzy Matching ✅
- **Levenshtein distance** algorithm for typo tolerance
- **Jaro-Winkler similarity** for better matching quality
- **Soundex phonetic** matching for similar-sounding words
- **N-gram similarity** for contextual matching
- **Basic stemming** for word variations (ing, ed, es, etc.)

#### 3. Comprehensive Performance Monitoring ✅
- Real-time metrics collection every 5 seconds
- Tracking indexing speed, search performance, memory usage
- Performance insights and bottleneck identification
- Health status scoring with actionable recommendations
- Export functionality for deep analysis

#### 4. Large Monorepo Optimization ✅
- Adaptive configuration for 50K+ file projects
- Prioritized src/lib directory processing
- Smart exclusion of vendor directories
- Optimized batch sizes for memory efficiency
- Memory usage thresholds and warnings
